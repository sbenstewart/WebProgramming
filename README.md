# WebProgramming
Straight for the class.
# Why this?
Ma'am gives code to be writted upfront in the class, which obviously I couldn't. Got used to the tab key auto predict feature for web development. I'm trying my best to change the way I code.
# Spoilers
I tend to use jQuery often, which has a bit of confusing syntax. Sorry for that. 
# Contributors Welcome
If some feature I've imlpemented can be done way easier please feel free to drop a pull request. This repo will be active most probably for the whole semester till April 2019.
